this is a asm8051 assembler.
it transforms asm8051 code to hex file.
it should work properly now.
it has some example in test directory.



there MUST be a enter(\n) at the last line of the code.
eg:
```
ORG 00H
LJMP $
```
will not work, as the end of command line LJMP  is not an enter.
we should write:
```
ORG 00H
LJMP $ ;<<<--here must be an enter before EOF

```

contact me if it do not work.
